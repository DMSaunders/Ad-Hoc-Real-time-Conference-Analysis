A team runs an annual 5-day training conference for up to 300 daily attendees and requires real-time, actionable insights on the proceedings. They use Google Forms to survey participants and vendors each day during and after the event. I provided an analysis by the close of each day's events to the team in order to prepare them to make changes for the next day.
